        <p><li>Whisk the eggs and milk together in a jug. Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients and pour in the wet ingredients. Use a whisk to combine everything and create a smooth batter. Fold through most of the chocolate chips.</li></p>
        <p><li>Heat a small knob of butter in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat, swirling it round to coat the pan. Add 2-3 tbsp of the batter to the pan and cook for 1-2 mins, or until bubbles begin to rise to the surface. Flip the pancake over and cook for 2 mins on the other side for the same amount of time, or until golden brown and puffed up. Repeat with the remaining batter, keeping the pancakes warm in a low oven.</li></p>
        <p><li>Stack the pancakes on plates and top with any leftover chocolate chips, butter, or maple syrup and if you like you can add all three.</li></p>
