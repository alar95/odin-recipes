# odin-recipes
<p>01/02/22: it is currently 19:37:51 i am setting up my readme.md file for my odin-recipes project. it will be used to create a crude webpage that will consist of a web index page which will contain links to several recipes. this project will be used to build my html skills and in the future i will return to this project when it has been completed to style it up using css. i will attempt to update this file as often as possible throughtout this project to create a timeline of events that can track my progress of what i did and when i did it when looking back.</p>
